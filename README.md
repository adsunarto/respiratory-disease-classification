# respiratory-disease-classification

The x-ray images/CT scans that I trained this network on came from https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset.

This is the first convolutional neural network I've worked on as well as my first time working with the TensorFlow-Keras API. Eventually, I'd like to learn how to write different types of networks for different modalities; however, I chose to learn how to classify images using a CNN as my first lesson because I thought it sounded the most interesting.
